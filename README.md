Fluidstate
==========

Compact statechart that can be vendored.


## How to use

A very simple example taken from specs.

```python
>>> from fluidstate import StateChart, State, Transition, states, transitions

>>> class SimpleMachine(StateChart):
...     initial = 'created'
...     states(
...         State(
...             'created',
...             transitions(
...                 Transition(event='queue', target='waiting'),
...                 Transition(event='cancel', target='canceled'),
...             ),
...         ),
...         State(
...             'waiting',
...             transitions(
...                 Transition(event='process', target='processed'),
...                 Transition(event='cancel', target='canceled'),
...             )
...         ),
...         State('processed'),
...         State('canceled'),
...     )

>>> machine = SimpleMachine()

>>> machine.state
'State(created)'

>>> machine.queue()

>>> machine.state
'State(waiting)'

>>> machine.process()

>>> machine.state
'State(processed)'

>>> cancel_machine = SimpleMachine()

>>> cancel_machine.state
'State(created)'

>>> cancel_machine.cancel()

>>> cancel_machine.state
'State(canceled)'
```


## A slightly more complex example

For demonstrating more advanced capabilities::

```python
>>> from fluidstate import (
...     StateChart,
...     State,
...     Transition,
...     states,
...     transitions,
... )

>>> class Relationship(StateChart):
...     initial = 'dating'
...     states(
...         State(
...             name='dating',
...             transitions=transitions(
...                 Transition(
...                     event='get_intimate', target='intimate', cond='drunk'
...                 )
...             ),
...             on_entry='make_happy',
...             on_exit='make_depressed',
...         ),
...         State(
...             name='intimate',
...             transitions=transitions(
...                 Transition(
...                     event='get_married',
...                     target='married',
...                     cond='willing_to_give_up_manhood',
...                 )
...             ),
...             on_entry='make_very_happy',
...             on_exit='never_speak_again',
...         ),
...         State(name='married', on_entry='give_up_intimacy', on_exit='buy_exotic_car')
...     )

...     def strictly_for_fun(self) -> None:
...         pass

...     def drunk(self) -> bool:
...         return True

...     def willing_to_give_up_manhood(self) -> bool:
...         return True

...     def make_happy(self) -> None:
...         pass

...     def make_depressed(self) -> None:
...         pass

...     def make_very_happy(self) -> None:
...         pass

...     def never_speak_again(self) -> None:
...         pass

...     def give_up_intimacy(self) -> None:
...         pass

...     def buy_exotic_car(self) -> None:
...         pass

>>> relationship = Relationship()
```


## States

A Fluidstate state machine must have one initial state and at least one other additional state.

A state may have pre and post callbacks, for running some code on state *on_entry*
and *on_exit*, respectively. These params can be method names (as strings),
callables, or lists of method names or callables.


## Transitions

Transitions lead the machine from a state to another. Transitions must have
the *event*, and *target* parameters. The *event* is the method that have to be
called to launch the transition. The *target* is the state to which the
transition will move the machine. This method is automatically created
by the Fluidstate engine.

A transition can have optional *action* and *cond* parameters. *action* is a
method (or callable) that will be called when transition is launched. If
parameters are passed to the event method, they are passed to the *action*
method, if it accepts these parameters. *cond* is a method (or callable) that
is called to allow or deny the transition, depending on the result of its
execution. Both "action" and *cond* can be lists.

The same event can be in multiple transitions, going to different states, having
their respective needs as selectors. For the transitions having the same event,
only one *cond* should return a true value at a time.
